# sinoalgo_simTests

This repository is to test whether algorithms in sinoalgo system work well. 

Tests are conducted by parsing the performance logs generated by trading system, the functions to parse and analyze key words for each cases are included. Each test case has a specific check function, such as check_order_completion() and check_order_lot(). In the check function, a successful test should return true. 

To start a new test, one should upload the corresponding logs, and run the check function for the case.

Until now there are six basic cases:

### Test Case 1: Order completion
The test case is for checking if the parent order in completed within the specified trading period.

### Test case 2: Order placement during noon break
The test case is to check whether the system is still creating or cancelling orders after morning session end.

The case is split into four sub-cases:

* End time between 11:30 and 13:00
* End time after 13:00

### Test case 3: Order placement after close auction start
The test case is to check if the system is still cancelling orders when close auction start, or creating orders after session end, and to check whether all the partially filled orders would be left into close auction

The case is split into three sub-cases:

* End time after 15:00 and not participate in close auction
* End time after 15:00 and participate in close auction
* End time between 14:57 and 15:00, cancel orders before 14:57

_This case is about close auction, not considered now_

### Test case 4: Order placement
The test is to check if the child order placement meets the order lot conditions, this case is devided into three sub-cases:

* STAR market stocks, whose order lot is 200
* mainboard and other second board stocks, whose order lot is 100

### Test case 5: Stop of a early completion
The test is to check if the strategy would stop quickly after a small order placement like 100 or 200 shares is completed

### Test case 6: Stop of a large order
The test is to check if a large order with a limit duration quickly stops after the parent order end time
